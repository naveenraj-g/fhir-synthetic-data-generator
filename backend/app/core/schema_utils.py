    Resolve all $ref pointers in a Pydantic model_json_schema() output by
    inlining the referenced definitions.

    Pydantic places sub-model schemas under a top-level "$defs" key and
    uses "$ref": "#/$defs/<Name>" pointers. When the schema is embedded
    inline inside a FastAPI responses={} dict, the "#/$defs/..." path can
    no longer be resolved because $defs is not at the root of the OpenAPI
    document. This function flattens the schema so every "$ref" is
    replaced with its actual content, producing a $ref-free inline schema
    safe for embedding.

    Circular references are broken by emitting { "type": "object" } on
    the second encounter of the same def.
